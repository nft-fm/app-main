        <SectionTitle>Our Commitment to Online Privacy</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          In these dark internet ages, it is often hard (if not impossible) to
          tell what information is being collected from you and how exactly it
          is being used. At NFT FM Inc. (“NFT FM”), we want to bring this
          information into the light. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will
          explain (without the legal jargon) how we use your information and
          will remind you that you have rights when it comes to controlling your
          information online.
        </SectionContent>
        <SectionContent>
          By continuing to use our online services, you agree to let us use your
          information in the ways set out in this privacy policy (the “Policy”),
          which is why you really should stick it out and read the whole thing.
          You should also head over and read our Terms of Use Agreement as there
          are important parts of that agreement that operate in conjunction with
          this agreement and that materially affect your right to bring a
          lawsuit against NFT FM in regards to this Policy. We believe our
          privacy practices are top-notch! But, if you disagree, we will be sad
          to see you leave.

        <SectionTitle>What Is Personal Information?</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          Personal Information is any information that may allow for an
          individual to be personally identified. For example, your name, email
          address, social security number, phone number, residential address,
          and credit card details are all considered personal information. Other
          information, such as your interests, economic status, customer number,
          IP address, cryptocurrency public key, geolocation, education, and job
          title, may also be considered personal information if that
          information, when combined with other information, is used to reveal
          your identity.

          We only collect personal information from you when you voluntarily

          Services as a “User” (using our Services to make non-fungible token
          purchases or interact with non-fungible tokens available on our Site
          or merely browsing our Services), or an “Artist” (using our Services
          to offer non-fungible tokens for purchase to Users), we may collect
          different information from you.

              Artists must first be verified manually through NFT FM (currently,
              we are only accepting select Artists) and then connect the
              MetaMask extension to our Site so that you can either make
              non-fungible tokens available yourself or use our white-glove
              service to have us make the content available for you. All Artists
              are required to provide their name, username, public key, profile
              picture, and we collect statistics on the non-fungible tokens that
              Artists make available (e.g., number sold, income earned, and
              other metadata attributed to the non-fungible tokens). If an
              Artist has signed up for our white-glove services, we may also
              need additional information from you, such as your email, phone
              number, and address. Additionally, information specifically
              uploaded in association with the non-fungible token such as
              Artist’s name, username, public key, profile picture, and
              information concerning a non-fungible token sale (such as the
              number minted, number sold, sale price, and image) will be

              <ListItemTitle>Why we use cookies:</ListItemTitle> We mainly use
              cookies to ensure our Services run smoothly. We also are a little
              nosey and use them to give us insight into things like the number
              of visitors to our Services, type of devices being used to access
              our Services, and details about how you have used our Services. As
              you have probably heard, cookies may also be used to display
              advertisements that are relevant to your interests. While we don’t

              advertising works by cookies collecting information about your
              interests and online habits. We use targeted advertising in an
              effort to market to audiences that we hope may be interested in
              our Services. That is why you may see some ‘paid’ or ‘sponsored’
              advertisements from NFT FM while using third-party platforms.

              or to stop certain types of cookies from being activated. If you
              decide to block cookies, our Services may not operate properly,

              safety, or a client’s property or safety, is at risk. In cases of
              fraud, we may also be required to share your information with
              investigatory authorities and banks.

        <SectionTitle>Personal Information Retention and Storage</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          At NFT FM, we only store your information for as long as we need it to
          render our Services. NFT FM is a business that is formed and operated
          in the United States. As such, the data we do collect is stored and
          processed in the United States. However, in addition to storing
          information directly onto our servers, we also use some third-party
          cloud storage systems, apps, and the blockchain ledger system to
          ensure that your information isn’t lost, to ensure all non-fungible
          token purchases and sales are tracked, and to allow for us to view
          information that may better our Services. It is important to note that
          these third parties may store and transfer your information outside of
          the United States, and therefore your information may be subject to
          international privacy and data storage laws. If you choose to
          disconnect the MetaMask extension from our Services, we will make
          reasonable efforts but cannot guarantee that all personal information
          associated with that account will be deleted from our servers; please
          reach out directly if you wish to ensure that all information has been
          deleted. We reserve the right to retain aggregated information that is
          disassociated with your personal information.

        <SectionTitle>Your Rights</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          Depending on your residency, under the law (such as the California
          Consumer Privacy Act and EU General Data Protection Regulation), you
          may have the right to request at any time for us to:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <ListItemTitle>Give you access</ListItemTitle> to any personal
              information that we have processed;
            </li>
            <li>
              <ListItemTitle>Correct</ListItemTitle> any personal information
              that may have been incorrectly processed;
            </li>
            <li>
              <ListItemTitle>Delete</ListItemTitle> your personal information
              from our storage systems;
            </li>
            <li>
              <ListItemTitle>Transfer</ListItemTitle> your personal information
              to another service, when technically feasible; and
            </li>
            <li>
              <ListItemTitle>Stop</ListItemTitle> using your personal
              information in specific ways by withdrawing the consent you have
              given us.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Regardless of whether we are obligated under the law or not, if you
          would like us to do any of the above, you can contact us using the
          information provided at the end of this Policy. We will do our best to
          try to fulfill your requests. However, sometimes we may be required to
          retain your information to comply with our administrative, legal,
          and/or regulatory obligations. For example, we may be required to keep
          a history of transactions to report our taxes or may need to retain
          some information for law enforcement purposes such as fraud
          monitoring, detection, and prevention. Further, although we will make
          all efforts to delete your personal information, we may keep aggregate
          information relating to your use of our Services provided they are no
          longer associated with you personally.

          Liability for Third-Party Software, Services & Apps
        </SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          We always use our best efforts to pick and use reputable third-party
          software, services, and apps. We make sure to check out the third
          party’s privacy and security standards before storing, sharing, and
          processing your personal information with them. However, we are not
          liable for any breach of privacy or data security that occurs due to
          the fault of these third parties.

        <SectionTitle>Keeping Your Information Safe</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          We have physical, electronic, and managerial systems and procedures in
          place to help keep your information under lock and key. Unfortunately,
          no online system can guarantee the complete security of your personal
          information. Issues such as pesky viruses or system failures may
          result in your personal information being compromised. You can help
          prevent unauthorized access to your information by using antivirus
          software, limiting access to your personal device, and changing your
          passwords from “123abc” to something a little less obvious. In the
          unlikely event that your personal information is compromised due to a
          security breach on our end, we will be sure to notify you as soon as
          reasonably possible in accordance with United States breach of data
          regulations and laws.

        <SectionTitle>Protection of Minors</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          Our Services are not targeted or intended to be used by people under
          the age of majority, and minors under the age of 13 are expressly
          prohibited. Permitted minors must have permission from their parent or
          guardian before accessing our Services. We do not intentionally
          collect personal information from anyone under the age of majority and
          delete this information as soon as we become aware of it. Please also
          note that if you live outside of the United States, your country may
          apply stricter age limits. In some cases, even if you are older than
          13, you may not be legally allowed to access or use our Services.

        <SectionTitle>Changes Made to This Policy</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          Times change, and we change with them. We may modify this Policy as
          our privacy practices and the laws surrounding privacy develop. The
          date at the top of this Policy lets you know when this Policy was last
          revised. It is on you to check back here occasionally to make sure you
          have read our latest policy. By continuing to access or use our
          Services after we revise our Policy, you allow us to use your
          information in the ways described in the updated policy.
        </SectionContent>
        <SectionTitle>Dispute Resolution</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          If you have a concern about our privacy practices, please let us know.
          We are always open to hearing about how we can improve our privacy
          practices, and we would like to hope that we could work out any
          complaints that you may have. However, if we are unable to settle the
          matter, then by using our Services, you agree to the binding
          arbitration provisions outlined in our Terms of Use Agreement.
