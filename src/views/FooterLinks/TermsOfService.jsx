        <SectionTitle>Description of Our Services</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          NFT FM is a music distribution platform that allows musical artists
          (the “Artist”) to create and sell non-fungible tokens incorporating
          music-related items such as sound recordings, event tickets,
          merchandise, and album artwork to users of the NFT FM Site (the
          “Users”). Users can purchase such content (either by paying a flat fee
          or participating in an auction) using Ethereum cryptocurrency. Once a
          purchase has been made, the User can access the content they purchased
          directly via our Site. Users can also “like” and share on their social
          media non-fungible tokens featured on our Site. From time to time, we
          may introduce new services and features, which will also be subject to
          this ToU.

              <ListItemTitle>What are Non-Fungible Tokens?</ListItemTitle>
              <br />
              “Non-fungible tokens” are built up of data that are then stored on
              the blockchain (a digital ledger). The word fungible means
              interchangeable or replaceable; so a token that is non-fungible is
              a token that can’t be replaced: it’s unique. Non-fungible tokens
              can be used to store artwork, music, animations, videos, VIP
              tickets, signatures… pretty much anything! When a person purchases
              that non-fungible token, they are purchasing a unique version of
              the content.

              <ListItemTitle>What is NFT FM’s Role?</ListItemTitle>
              <br />
              NFT FM provides an administrative platform that allows for
              non-fungible token sales to occur and for Users to access their
              purchased non-fungible tokens. However, we are not a broker,
              financial institute, or creditor. We are also not a party to the
              sale agreement between Artists and Users.

        <SectionTitle>Connecting to NFT FM</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          Want to just browse our Services? Go right ahead; no account or
          third-party connection is needed. If you are an Artist that wants to
          create a non-fungible token on our Site or a User that wants to make a
          purchase or interact by liking or sharing non-fungible tokens
          available on our Site, you will need to connect to our Site through
          the MetaMask extension. MetaMask allows you to link your existing
          cryptocurrency wallets, create a cryptocurrency wallet, and purchase,
          store and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. Need
          help? We have some guides and videos available on our Site to help you
          with this process.

              If you are an Artist and would like to create non-fungible tokens
              on our Site, you will need to be verified manually through our
              systems and must sign and comply with our Services & Artist
              Licensing Agreement. Currently, we are only accepting limited
              Artists to use our Site, but you can reach out to us directly at

              Once you have successfully linked your MetaMask account to our
              Site, you will be able to purchase non-fungible tokens (provided
              you have enough cryptocurrency available in your account) and
              interact by sharing or liking non-fungible tokens available on our
              Site. Any purchases and interactions that occur on our Site are
              completed via an automated online process.

          reserve pricing. All purchases and bidding are completed by MetaMask,
          completely independent from NFT FM, and we are not responsible for
          transactions that occur. Sales are final and non-refundable.

        <SectionTitle>NFT FM Fees</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          Currently, our Services are available to all Users for free. However,
          we may in the future offer some paid features within our Site. You
          will always be notified if a feature you wish to use on our Site is a
          paid feature. There also may come a time when we need to charge a fee
          for our Site or may need to make changes to our pricing; as such,
          prices advertised are not guaranteed. Payment for features are due
          upon confirmation of a purchase. Additionally, when a purchase of a
          non-fungible token is made, a small commission-based fee is sent to us
          at the same time the payment is made to the Artist.

          offices within the United States of America and are not intended to be
          subject to the laws or jurisdiction of any country outside of the

          ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
          Those who choose to access NFT FM outside of the United States of

          YOU READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS SECTION

              <ListItemTitle>Letting Us Know About Complaints</ListItemTitle>
              <br />
              At NFT FM, we hope that we can work out any complaints or
              differences that we may have with you respectfully and calmly. If
              you have any concerns about the Services that NFT FM provides,
              please reach out to us to let us know. If we cannot work out our
              differences together, then the following mandatory binding
              arbitration will apply to resolve the dispute.
            </li>

            <li>
              <ListItemTitle>Mandatory Binding Arbitration</ListItemTitle>
              <br />
              If any controversy or claim arising out of, or relating to, this
              ToU, NFT FM’s Services, or our Privacy Policy cannot be amicably
              resolved, such controversy or claim will be determined by binding
              arbitration rather than in a court of law. Except that mandatory
              binding arbitration will not apply with respect to any claims
              relating to infringement or misuse of intellectual property. The
              binding arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration
              Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
              Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) and
              administered by the AAA. Arbitration must be commenced by filing a
              demand for arbitration with the AAA within one (1) year after the
              claim occurs or within one (1) year of the party asserting the
              claim becoming reasonably aware of the act or omission giving rise
              to the claim. If applicable law prohibits a one-year statute of
              limitations for asserting claims, claims must be asserted within
              the shortest period of time permitted by the applicable law. If an
              arbitrator determines a claim to be frivolous, you agree to
              reimburse NFT FM for all fees associated with the arbitration,
              including attorneys’ fees and arbitration costs.

              <ListItemTitle>Class Action Waiver</ListItemTitle>
              <br />
              You agree to waive any right to participate in a class or
              representative action or proceeding and warrant that any claims
              brought against NFT FM will be initiated only in your individual
              capacity. Any relief awarded by an arbitrator or otherwise will
              not affect other users of NFT FM Services.

        <SectionTitle>Survival of Terms Beyond Termination</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          All provisions in this ToU or Privacy Policy that specifically state
          or logically ought to survive the termination of our ToU or Privacy
          Policy, or the termination of a user’s access to our services will
          survive such termination, including without limitation arbitration,
          representations and warranties, indemnification, limitation of
          liability, intellectual property ownership, and arbitration
          provisions.
        </SectionContent>
        <SectionTitle>Waiver and Severability</SectionTitle>
        <SectionContent>
          No waiver by NFT FM of any term or condition in this ToU will be

          other term or condition of this ToU or any other agreement. If any
          term or condition in this ToU is declared to be invalid, illegal, or
          unenforceable, for any reason, the remainder of the provisions will
