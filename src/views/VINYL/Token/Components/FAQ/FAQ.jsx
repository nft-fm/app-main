      <Question
        question="Did someone say Airdrops?!"
        answer="Yes! We are going to be airdropping 30% of the unburned $VINYL supply over 4 years! This comes to 2,500 $VINYL at the start of every month beginning July 2021 
        and ending June 2025. These tokens will be airdropped equally to all holders of FANFARE NFTs. Each NFT represents a percentage of the tokens to be received. So holding multiple NFTs = more airdrop!"

      <Question
        question="Governance and Proposals"
        answer="Our governance board is composed of a reddit-style commenting and voting system. Each month we will publish an article directly addressing the top three highest voted proposals. In addition to that, we have a community polling system where we will be asking the community more direct yes/no style questions on topics such as features, collaborations, and how resources should be allocated. 
        The FANFARE team will do itâ€™s best to ensure that the results of polls and community desires are respected and pursued. We will be publishing a history log of the polls taken and the resulting actions taken by FANFARE."

        question="NFT Farming"
        answer="In early July, we plan to release two new staking pools. These pools will be for $VINYL staking, and $VINYL-LP staking. Staking $VINYL or $VINYL-LP will
         earn you BITTUNES points which grow towards redeemable mystery boxes. What will be in those boxes you ask?"
      />
      <Question
        question="Artist Launchpad"
        answer="We are starting a new artist launchpad program. The goal of this is to introduce rising artists to our community while also giving NFTs from these 
        musicians to our community for FREE! Any $VINYL holder or $VINYL liquidity provider can stake their tokens and race to redeem these free monthly NFTs. 
        We will be featuring a new artist every month and each artist launch will be accompanied by a blog post about their music."
